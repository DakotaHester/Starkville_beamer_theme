# Starkville - a Mississippi State University inspired theme for LaTeX Beamer presentations

This is a Beamer theme I created for my presentations as a grad student at MSU. It is a re-working of the PaloAlto theme, with MSU colors and a few other tweaks to make it more visually appealing. [A sample presentation is included in the repository to show how the theme looks in action.](example_presentation.pdf)

The upper-right corner of the slides includes a region that is approximately the same proportions as MSU's vertical university unit assets, [which can be found here](https://www.brand.msstate.edu/assets/secondaryunitlogos.php). None of the logos are included in this repository, so you will need to supply your own. The included sample presentation uses the [GCER Lab logo](https://www.gcerlab.com).

**None of the images or logos used in this demo presentation or contained within this repository are mine, and I do not claim any ownership of them.** They are the property of [Mississippi State University](https://www.msstate.edu/) or [GCER Lab](https://www.gcerlab.com). The theme itself is released under the LPPL license (included in the header of the `.sty` file and as `LICENSE.md` in this repository).

## Usage

Simply copy the `beamerthemeStarkville.sty` file into the same directory as your `.tex` file, and include the line `\usetheme{Starkville}` in the preamble of your document. See [the sample presentation](example_presentation.tex) for an example of how to use the theme.
